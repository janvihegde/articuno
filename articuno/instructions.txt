1. Remove TailwindCSS (for non-tailwind users)
In each HTML file:
Delete the <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> line.
Remove all TailwindCSS-specific classes from the elements.

3. Create styles.css (for non-tailwind users)
Create a new file named styles.css in the same directory as your HTML files. Use this file to define all the styling for your project.

4. Add Optional JavaScript in index.js
If functionality is needed, create an index.js file in the project folder. Link it to the HTML files by adding this line before the closing </body> tag:
<script src="index.js"></script>

5. Ensure your project looks like this:
/project-folder
  |- index.html
  |- store.html
  |- about.html
  |- game-details.html
  |- cart.html
  |- contact.html
  |- styles.css
  |- index.js
